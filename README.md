## Introduction 

Our task here was to add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.  This means that a user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection.  When entering transactions offline, they will update the total current balance when brought back online.

## Instructions

Type NPM install in the terminal after cloning this repo and then npm install lite-server --save-dev.  From there a user has access to the functionality and can begin by adding a balance to their budget.  Subsequent entries for payments and credits and additional deposits will update the balance.  

## Features

Should the internet connection go out, as it frequently does at our house thanks to a much outdated local power grid infrastructure which still relies on above ground power lines subject to many falling trees during storms, a user can still use this app offline.  Their balance will update automatically when the internet eventually comes back.  When our city joins the 21st century and buries power lines underground, this feature will no longer be as necessary for us.
